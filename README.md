# CSV Analyzer
This project is an exercise to learn Python.

# Usage
Clone the repo and run it using `python analyzer.py <file_name>`.

# Maintenance
Since this is an academic project, I only intend on maintaining and adding functionality to experiment with new concepts. Otherwise, this project won't be actively maintained.
